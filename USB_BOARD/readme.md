This optional board provides a user accessible standard USB Type A 5VDC regulated charging port with a 
maximum charging current of 2A. When installed the board is automatically sensed by the controller and 
will add the capability of monitoring the USB charge voltage and current. The board has an internal 
jumper to program whether the USB D+ and D- are shorted to initiate charging as required by some devices.
