This optional board provides for programmable overcurrent protection of the battery and regulator 
output using ultra-low impedance power MOSFETs. They provide disconnection of the battery from the 
regulator and/or disconnection of the load from the regulator by either a software setpoint or the 
internal hardware defined maximum setpoints. These are independent of the fuses on the main board 
and are designed to provide faster response and protection than the fuses. A programmable time 
delay may be set for loads that have a brief surge or inrush current higher than the normal maximum 
current.

This board also provides an internal test load and switch for performing built-in self testing of 
the regulator and each of the modules installed individually and together. It provides momentary 
loading of the internal supplies to prevent overheating of the internal load and is not manually 
accessible.
