This board provides for a fixed regulated voltage output for a variable input voltage in the extreme range of 
9-48VDC but is designed for nominal 12VDC or 24VDC Battery power from a SLA (Sealed Lead Acid) or LiFePO4 
(Lithium Iron Phosphate) Battery pack.

This board is designed for use with the main board and user interface board as a minimal configuration for 
use in mobile or portable applications for communications, AV, emergency services or other battery powered 
field applications where high efficiency, low audio and electrical noise are required.

This unit is designed for low conducted and radiated EMI/RFI emissions suitable for powering high frequency 
communications equipment. The spread spectrum switching frequency and up to 4 phase interleaving of the 
switching frequency is design to produce minimal output ripple and situate all low order harmonic outside 
of the radio amateur and other HF emergency communications frequencies in the 1.8-30MHz range.
